Feign is a declarative HTTP client that makes it easy to integrate and call RESTful APIs 
from within a Spring Boot application. It abstracts the boilerplate code required for 
making HTTP requests, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than low-level 
networking details.


Feign is a declarative HTTP client, which means you can define an interface and Feign 
will automatically implement it for you, handling the HTTP communication.

Feign uses annotations to define the endpoints and HTTP methods.

It integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud, making it easier to call microservices in a 
distributed architecture.
